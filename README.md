# TEXT_SIMULARITY_USING_BERT-MODEL.
## Explanation:-
This project utilizes BERT model to compute similarity scores between a given reference text and multiple other texts, enabling comparison and quantification of their textual similarity.


#### Detaiil Explanation:-
In this project there are given three sample texts. And the second and third text compare to the 1st text and give the simularity score of how much the 2nd text simular to 1st, and how much the 3rd text compare to the 1st.

we can how many texts we want to comapare in the "TEXT" list but all the other texts compare to the 1st text in the list. And give the simularity score.
